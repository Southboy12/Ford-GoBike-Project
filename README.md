# Ford-GoBike-System-Data-Analysis

## Dataset
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It consists of information regarding 183,412 bike trips including duration, start time, end time, user type, gender, and other ride information. The data can be found in the repository [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv)


## Summary of Findings

There is a huge difference in the number of rides across some locations. This may be attributed to factors such as traffic conditions or population size in those areas.

Only about 23% of the riders identify as female. 74% of the riders are male.

It appears that rides are high on weekdays compared to weekends. Thursday has the highest ride while Saturday has the least

The higher ride frequencies for morning (8th and 9th hours) and evening (17th and 18th hours) can be linked to the rush hours where people are leaving for work and come later in the evening.

Weekend trips take longer as compared to trips taken during the week

The average ride duration for male is smaller compared to females and other gender.The line cutting each bar represents the amount of variation in the values.The variation in duration is relatively higher for `Other` and lower for `Male`and `Female` 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the influence of the start day and start time on duration of trips. I started by introducing the duration variable followed by the pattern in the start day distribution, then plot the barchart.

Afterwards, I introduced the start time variable. I used a barplot to show it's relation with duration.
